To install the Tinder Backend repository, follow these steps:

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository using Git by running the following command in your terminal:

git clone repo
Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate into the cloned repository and install the required dependencies:

cd tinder-backend
npm install
or

cd tinder-backend
yarn install
Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a new file named .env in the root of the project and add your environment variables. For example:

/tinder-backend/.env

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=tinder
Replace the values with your actual database credentials.

Step 4: Start the Server
Start the server using the following command:

npm start
or

yarn start

Step 5: Access the API
Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or cURL.

Remember to replace the DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_NAME variables in the .env file with your actual database credentials.

Please note that you need to have Node.js and a package manager like npm or yarn installed on your system to install and run the repository. If you don't have them installed, you can download and install them from the official Node.js website.
